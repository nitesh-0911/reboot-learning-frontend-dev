        <h1>CSS - Day-5</h1>
        <h2>Learing CSS Positions</h2>
        <p>The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left
            physical
            properties and the inset-block-start, inset-block-end, inset-inline-start, and inset-inline-end
            flow-relative logical
            properties can be used to determine the final location of positioned elements.</p>
        <h3>Static</h3>
        <p>The element is positioned according to the Normal Flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and
            z-index
            properties have no effect. This is the default value.</p>
        <h3>Relative</h3>
        <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself
            based on the
            values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus,
            the space
            given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.</p>
        <p>This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto. Its effect on table-*-group,
            table-row,
            table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined.</p>
        <h3>Absolute</h3>
        <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page
            layout. The
            element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any) or to the initial containing
            block. Its final
            position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</p>
        <p>This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto. The margins of absolutely
            positioned
            boxes do not collapse with other margins.</p>
        <h3>Fixed</h3>
        <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page
            layout. The
            element is positioned relative to its initial containing block, which is the viewport in the case of visual
            media. Its
            final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</p>
        <p>This value always creates a new stacking context. In printed documents, the element is placed in the same
            position on
            every page.</p>
        <h3>Sticky</h3>
        <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its
            nearest
            scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related elements,
            based on the
            values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.</p>
        <p>
            This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky element "sticks" to its nearest
            ancestor that has a
            "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor
            isn't the
            nearest actually scrolling ancestor.
